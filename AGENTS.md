## Architecture rules
- Public opportunity reads go through `src/lib/opportunities.functions.ts` (publishable-key server client) so listing pages SSR; why: anon RLS read policy, no session on server.
- Student-owned data (profiles, saved_opportunities) is read/written from the browser client under RLS; why: RLS scopes rows to auth.uid().
- Opportunity writes are admin-only via `public.has_role`; roles live in `user_roles`; why: prevents privilege escalation.
- Demo rows carry `is_demo = true` and must be labeled in the UI; why: never present fake opportunities as real.
- Profile pictures live in the private `avatars` bucket under `<user_id>/…`, shown via signed URLs; why: storage RLS limits access to the owner folder.
- Group membership RLS uses security-definer `is_group_member`/`is_group_creator` functions, never self-referencing policies; why: a policy querying its own table causes infinite recursion, and insert policies can't read rows the read policy hides.
- Group creation generates the id in the server function and inserts without `.select()`; why: the read policy requires membership, which doesn't exist until after the owner row is inserted.
- Assistant history is stored in owner-scoped conversations/messages and replayed from storage through an authenticated streaming route; why: preserve private history without trusting a client-provided transcript.
- Assistant catalog saves require AI SDK tool approval and use the user's RLS client; why: restrict writes to explicit student-owned saves, never shared opportunity mutations.
- Assistant provider access blocks persist in server-owned access state; why: prevent reloads from retrying terminal provider denials.
